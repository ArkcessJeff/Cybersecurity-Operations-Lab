## **The Prevalence of Email Threats in SOC Operations**
Email-based threats are among the most frequent attacks encountered by Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts, often occurring multiple times within a single shift. These malicious emails commonly serve as the initial entry point for attackers seeking access to a target environment. With the increasing prevalence of such threats, SOC analysts and cyber investigators must understand the techniques adversaries use to launch email-based attacks, as well as how to investigate and mitigate them effectively. Attackers frequently rely on phishing emails for initial access, leveraging various evasion tactics to bypass security measures and deceive victims through social engineering. To combat these threats, it is crucial to analyze secure email gateway logs and develop strong investigative techniques for identifying and responding to suspicious emails.

## **Common Initial Access Techniques in Cyber Attacks** 
Attackers follow a structured approach in the cyberattack chain, beginning with reconnaissance on the target's environment and infrastructure, followed by preparing the necessary tools and tactics. The next critical step is selecting an initial access method to infiltrate the victim’s environment. Adversaries employ various techniques to achieve this, including phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, leveraging drive-by compromises to lure users into visiting malicious websites, and stealing legitimate remote access credentials such as VPN or RDP. For security professionals, understanding these initial access techniques is essential for early detection and mitigation, preventing potential threats before they escalate into full-scale attacks.

## **Why Phishing Emails Are a Preferred Initial Access Method**
Attackers favor phishing emails as an initial access method due to their effectiveness in exploiting human vulnerabilities and the ease of execution. A phishing email is a social engineering tactic designed to deceive victims into opening malicious files, clicking harmful links, or divulging sensitive information such as passwords and financial details. Several factors contribute to phishing’s success:

- **Ease of acquiring target email addresses:**  
  - During the reconnaissance phase, attackers can easily gather a list of target email addresses.  
  - Sources include job postings, social media platforms like LinkedIn, third-party subscriptions, data leaks, web archives (e.g., Archive.org), and marketing databases (e.g., ZoomInfo.com).  
  - This enables highly targeted and personalized attacks.  

- **Simplicity of weaponization:**  
  - Attackers can easily upload malware to legitimate cloud services and distribute the download link via email.  
  - Malicious attachments can be crafted using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.  
  - Executable malware can be sent in compressed formats to bypass basic security measures.  

- **Exploitation of low security awareness:**  
  - Many users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks.  
  - A significant number of employees lack proper security awareness training, making them easy targets.  

Given these factors, phishing remains a preferred and effective method for attackers to establish initial access. Now that we understand why adversaries rely on phishing emails, we will explore different types of email threats.
