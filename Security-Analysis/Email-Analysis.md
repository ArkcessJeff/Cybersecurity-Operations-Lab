Email-based threats are among the most frequent attacks encountered by Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts, often occurring multiple times within a single shift. These malicious emails commonly serve as the initial entry point for attackers seeking access to a target environment. With the increasing prevalence of such threats, SOC analysts and cyber investigators must understand the techniques adversaries use to launch email-based attacks, as well as how to investigate and mitigate them effectively. Attackers frequently rely on phishing emails for initial access, leveraging various evasion tactics to bypass security measures and deceive victims through social engineering. To combat these threats, it is crucial to analyze secure email gateway logs and develop strong investigative techniques for identifying and responding to suspicious emails.
